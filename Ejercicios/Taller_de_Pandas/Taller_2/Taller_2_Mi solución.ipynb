Hot Dog Stand  \n","Create a DataFrame that contains the beginning inventory for a hot dog stand: 20 hot dogs, 20 cans of coke, 20 bottles of water and 10 soft pretzels. Each time a sale is made, the user will enter the quantity of items sold and the DataFrame will be updated to reflect the new available inventory. Output the updated DataFrame after each update. The program must allow the user to continue to enter sales until all the items are sold. Once an item's inventory has been depleted, print a message notifying the user that the item can no longer be sold. If the user tries to record the sale of an item after its inventory has been depleted, print a message alerting the user to their mistake. Once all the items have been depleted, print \"All items have been sold\" and exit the program."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"z-QWR07lb0zI","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":314},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1608324025980,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":641,"user":{"displayName":"Daniel Castaño","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gj6i_lrbIYJIqjUklcVFUIK5L1oG5SSqOBHXJ1j=s64","userId":"06079181489000454593"}},"outputId":"a9d22f13-4270-4b05-e196-ad1d9b8aca43"},"source":["import pandas as pd\r\n","df_hds = pd.DataFrame.from_dict({'Product':['hot dogs','coke','water','pretzels'],\r\n","                                 'Quantity':[20,20,20,10]})\r\n","display(df_hds)\r\n","df_hds.loc[df_hds['Product']=='coke', 'Quantity'] -= 1\r\n","display(df_hds)\r\n"],"execution_count":21,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Product</th>\n","      <th>Quantity</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>hot dogs</td>\n","      <td>20</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>coke</td>\n","      <td>20</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>water</td>\n","      <td>20</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>pretzels</td>\n","      <td>10</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["    Product  Quantity\n","0  hot dogs        20\n","1      coke        20\n","2     water        20\n","3  pretzels        10"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Product</th>\n","      <th>Quantity</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>hot dogs</td>\n","      <td>20</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>coke</td>\n","      <td>19</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>water</td>\n","      <td>20</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>pretzels</td>\n","      <td>10</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["    Product  Quantity\n","0  hot dogs        20\n","1      coke        19\n","2     water        20\n","3  pretzels        10"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Gc8FDZQjb0zJ"},"source":["### 2.
